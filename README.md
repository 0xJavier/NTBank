# NTBank

NTBank is an app aimed to streamline the Monopoly experience by removing the need for paper money and a dedicated banker. Each player now has a customizable card that displays their current balance and allows them to send money to other players and react to in game events all through the app. You no longer need to setup and count paper money in the beginning and end of the game as the app keeps up to date rankings of each player.

This was an awesome personal project to work on as it was a real world problem I had to take from designing in Sketch to a finished product. Towards the winter holidays, I play a lot of board games with family and friends and we found it a hassle to always setup and count the paper money in addition to having a player bombarded with banking request from 5 other players. This app allowed me to transition from follow along tutorials to creating my own fully featured app.
